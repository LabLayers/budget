# Trip to St. Louis for FIRST World Championships

**Dates**: Tuesday April 21 to Sunday April 26

**Funding**: Anonymous donor from phillydev.org :heart:

I will be in St. Louis for the FIRST Robotics world championships! I was about to start a GoFundMe page with since this trip will cost more than my past 11 trips _combined_, but someone who does not want to be identified was kind enough to cover the costs of the entire trip (+ donate additional money to my robotics team.) In return, I'll be transparent about how I spend that money by open sourcing it on GitHub and posting proofs of puchases if I am allowed to do so.

### Housing

There were no other rooms available in St. Louis and my friend in Ferguson is an hour commute away from the event.

I'm splitting a room in the Westin with 3 other team members since I am required to stay with my team member and I don't have much of a choice.

However, these rooms have only beds to accomidate 1 person so I have to purchase a twin size air mattress in order to sleep on the floor.

|--------|------|
| Hotel Room after split | $300 |

Room paid with check, air matress material paid with cash.

## Estimates

### Food

I am expected to spend money for breakfast and lunch, and potentially some overpriced italian ice if I am not allowed leave the convention center until the day is over. Dinners are covered by the team budget. In most cases, I have no control on where to eat and it won't be the cheapest option.

Here is the estimated cost for food, I'll update this with actual totals after the trip:

| Item | Cost |
|--------|------|
| Rest Area Stops | $10*2 |
| Breakfast | $8/day*4 |
| Lunch | $12/day*4 |
| Snacks | $8/day*4 |
| **Total** | $142 |

### Misc

| Item | Cost |
|--------|------|
| Souvenirs | $20 |
| [RoboProm](http://www.team399.org/roboprom2015/) | $30 |
| Emergency Money | $50 |
| **Total** | $50-100 |


### Final Totals

TBD
